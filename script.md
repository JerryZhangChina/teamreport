The Impact of Social Media on Teens: A Student's Perspective

Multitasking has become a common theme in our lives. It’s a wonder how we manage it all. We depend on our smartphones for work, school, our personal and social lives. When was the last time you left home without your phone and kept on going? The internet has become a significant part of our daily lives. So too has social media, and it is having a profound impact on today’s teens.

#### Social Media Usage

Back in 2005, when social media was still in its infancy, only about 5 percent of users in the United States were involved in social media. By 2019, that number grew to about 70 percent. According to surveys, while adults predominantly use platforms like YouTube and Facebook, teens prefer Snapchat and Instagram, with TikTok rapidly gaining popularity.

Social media use is nearly universal among today’s teens, with 97 percent of 13- to 17-year-olds using at least one of the major online platforms. The amount of time spent on these sites is staggering; reports indicate that the average teen spends about nine hours on social media each day.

Like most things, using social media has its positives, cautionary tales, and dangers that significantly impact our lives.

#### Pros: Why is Social Media Good?

Social media and technology offer us greater convenience and connectivity:

- Staying connected with family and friends worldwide via email, text, and video calls.
- Quick access to information and research.
- Opportunities for online learning and skill development.
- Involvement in civic engagement and social awareness.
- Great marketing tools and remote employment opportunities.

While social media can be a positive force, it’s essential to recognize when something feels off. If we ever feel uncomfortable about something we see or read online, we should trust our instincts and talk to someone we trust, whether it’s a parent, teacher, or friend.

#### Cons: Why is Social Media Bad?

However, with the good comes the bad. The nature of social media presents a range of potential issues:

- **Online vs. Reality:** Social media can create a false sense of connection. "Friends" online may not be true friends, leading to feelings of isolation.
- **Increased Usage:** Excessive time on social media can lead to cyberbullying, social anxiety, and exposure to inappropriate content.
- **Addiction:** The dopamine rush from likes and comments can create addictive behaviors, making it hard to disconnect.
- **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):** The constant urge to check social media can affect mental health and lead to anxiety.
- **Self-Image Issues:** Social media can distort our self-image, leading to body image concerns and unhealthy comparisons.

#### Social Media and Bullying

Sadly, there is an ugly side to social media: cyberbullying. This modern form of bullying is more constant and pervasive. Statistics show that a significant number of teens experience bullying, both in person and online. Many do not report these incidents, leading to a culture of silence and fear.

#### Social Media and Suicide

The negative effects of social media can be severe, contributing to mental health issues among young people. Suicide remains one of the leading causes of death among children under 14, with rates increasing in recent years.

#### A Student's Perspective

As a student navigating the complexities of social media, I often feel the pressure to maintain an online presence. The constant comparison to others can be overwhelming, and it’s easy to feel inadequate when scrolling through curated images of peers’ lives. I sometimes find myself caught in the cycle of checking notifications, fearing that I might miss out on something important. 

While social media allows me to connect with friends and share experiences, it can also be a source of anxiety. I’ve learned to set boundaries for myself, like limiting my screen time and taking breaks from social media when it becomes too much. It’s crucial to remember that what we see online is often not the full picture. 

In conclusion, social media is a double-edged sword. It has the power to connect us and provide opportunities, but it also poses risks that we must navigate carefully. It’s important for us to support each other, communicate openly about our experiences, and seek help when needed. Balancing our online and offline lives is essential for our mental health and well-being.
